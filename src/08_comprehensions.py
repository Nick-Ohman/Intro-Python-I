"""
List comprehensions are one cool and unique feature of Python.
They essentially act as a terse and concise way of initializing
and populating a list given some expression that specifies how
the list should be populated. 

Take a look at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
for more info regarding list comprehensions.

# Write a list comprehension to produce the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

y = []
for n in range(0, 5):
    y.append(n + 1)

print (y)

# Write a list comprehension to produce the cubes of the numbers 0-9:
# [0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729]

y = []
for x in range(0, 9):
    y.append(x ** 3)
print(y)

# Write a list comprehension to produce the uppercase version of all the
# elements in array a. Hint: "foo".upper() is "FOO".

a = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

y = [a.upper() for a in a]

# for x in range(len(a)):
#     y.append(a[x].upper())

# Use a list comprehension to create a list containing only the _even_ elements
# the user entered into list x.

x = input("Enter comma-separated numbers: ").split(',')

# What do you need between the square brackets to make it work?
y = [x for x in x if int(x) % 2 == 0]

# for item in x:
#     if int(item) % 2 == 0:
#         y.append(int(item))
